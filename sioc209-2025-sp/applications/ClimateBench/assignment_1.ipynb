    "This assignment encourages a thorough exploration of machine learning techniques in the context of climate science, focusing on hands-on experience and critical analysis. You will be working with the [ClimateBench](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021MS002954) dataset, which contains inputs and associated climate model output from a full complexity Earth System Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand the application of different machine learning models to climate-related regression tasks.\n",
    "- Explore and adjust baseline models (Random Forest, Gaussian Process Regression, CNN-LSTM) to enhance performance.\n",
    "- Analyze and report on the effectiveness of model adjustments.\n"

    "     - Modifying the input features (e.g., adding new features, transforming existing features).\n",
    "     - Applying different data pre-processing techniques.\n",
    "   - Justify each adjustment based on theoretical or empirical evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Results Analysis (15% of grade)**\n",
    "   - Compare the performance of the original and adjusted models using appropriate statistical metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R-squared).\n",
