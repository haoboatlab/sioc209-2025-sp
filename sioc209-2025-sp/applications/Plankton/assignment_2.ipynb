    "In this assignment, you will be working with Jeff Ellen's Plankton dataset, which contains images of plankton. The dataset is available on Google Drive through the link on Canvas. The goal is to classify the plankton images into one of multiple classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand the dataset and the problem of classifying plankton images.\n",
    "- Explore and adjust the baseline model to enhance performance to learn the effects of key hyperparameters.\n",
    "- Analyze and report on the effectiveness of model adjustments."

    "     - Applying different data pre-processing and augmentation techniques\n",
    "   - Justify each adjustment based on theoretical or empirical evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Results Analysis (15% of grade)**\n",
    "   - Compare the performance of the original and adjusted models using appropriate statistical metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score).\n",
    "   - Discuss the effectiveness of each adjustment in improving the model's performance.\n",
